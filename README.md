## About
This was used for my final project for MGMT 3210 - Business App Programming. 

The idea is that you select the core requirements class that you need to take - ie. a human diversity, or an ideas and values, etc - and the FCQ data will be filtered and sorted to show what classes are available, and out of those classes the ones with the highest GPA.

This link contains the excel sheet with the 2017 FCQ data and requirements already included. Everything will need to be enabled when the file is opened:

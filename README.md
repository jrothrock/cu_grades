# CU Class Picker

** Note, this will only work on Windows due to needing ActiveX **

## How It Works

Input what classes you need to take - ex. A human diversity, an ideals and values - and it will select from the list of classes, for that subject, the one that has the highest GPA average. In time, it'd be sweet if this was able to do a full schedule, as well as compare you to the students around you.

This uses public information provided by CU - the FCQ excel downloads, as well as the student demographic data.
